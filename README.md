## Welcome!

I'm Jacob Deichert and I'm a software developer from Nanaimo, BC. Thanks for coming to check out my work.

ðŸ§° Most of my experience is based around **Node**, **Go**, **TypeScript**, **React** and **Svelte**. For side projects, my favourite stack currently is **Rust** for the backend (using my custom framework built on top of hyper) and **Solid** on the frontend. I've also been [experimenting][2] with **WebAssembly** and I'm looking forward to releasing another project soon.

ðŸ›  I enjoy building dev tools and automating things. [Mask][4] is a CLI task runner which uses a markdown file to define commands. [Svelvet][5] was an experiment in building an esm-based compiler for Svelte.

ðŸ§ª This year I'm hoping to get into IoT and embedded development with Rust.

ðŸ“˜ I sometimes write about things on my [blog][6].
